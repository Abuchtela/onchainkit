# `<Earn />`

The `Earn` component provides a simple interface for earning interest on your crypto via Morpho vaults on Base.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `Earn` component, ensure you've completed the [Getting Started](/getting-started) steps.

### Starting a new project

If you're starting a new project, we recommend using `create onchain` to scaffold your project. 

```bash
npm create onchain@latest
```

### Adding to an existing project

If you're adding `Earn` to an existing project, simply install OnchainKit.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @coinbase/onchainkit
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @coinbase/onchainkit
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @coinbase/onchainkit
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @coinbase/onchainkit
```

:::

Wrap the `<OnchainKitProvider />` around your app, following the steps in [Getting Started](/getting-started#add-providers).

## Quickstart

To use `Earn`, you'll need to provide a `vaultAddress` prop. A vault address can be obtained from Morpho's [Vaults page](https://app.morpho.org/base/earn).

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors: 2307
import { Earn } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/earn'; // [!code focus]

<Earn vaultAddress="0x7BfA7C4f149E7415b73bdeDfe609237e29CBF34A" /> // [!code focus]
```

<EarnMain />

## Customization

### Custom components and layouts

`Earn` accepts a `children` prop that can be used to render `Earn` subcomponents or custom components. 

For instance, you can render the `EarnDeposit` component by itself within the `Earn` component, along with any other custom components you'd like to render.

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors: 2307
import { Earn, EarnDeposit } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/earn';

<Earn vaultAddress="0x7BfA7C4f149E7415b73bdeDfe609237e29CBF34A">
  <div>Custom header</div>
  <EarnDeposit />
  <div>Custom footer</div>
</Earn>
```

<EarnDeposit />

For more granular control, you can also render lower level subcomponents within `EarnDeposit` and `EarnWithdraw`. These subcomponents accept `className` props to customize their styles.

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors: 2307
import { Earn, EarnDeposit, EarnDetails, DepositBalance, DepositAmountInput, DepositButton } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/earn';

<Earn vaultAddress="0x7BfA7C4f149E7415b73bdeDfe609237e29CBF34A">
  <EarnDeposit>
    <EarnDetails />
    <DepositBalance />
    <DepositAmountInput className="border-2 border-green-400" />
    <DepositButton />
  </EarnDeposit>
</Earn>
```

<RearrangedEarnDeposit />

### Customizing styles

The `Earn` component is best styled via a [OnchainKit theme](/guides/themes#custom-theme). You can also override individual component styles using `className`.

Below, we implement a custom input which resembles predefined amounts rather than a free-form input.



## Advanced Usage
If you'd like to implement your own custom components, you can use `useEarnContext` within an `Earn` component to access context and build your own components.

You can find the full interface for `EarnContextType` on the [Types page](/earn/types#earncontexttype).

<PredefinedInputDeposit />
